<h4>California – San Francisco</h4>
<p>California is a great place to visit and live. There is so much to do in this beautiful city. As a nature freak, I love visiting the Muir Woods, Giant Redwoods and Sausalito. We wandered through an ancient coastal redwood forest and explored the artistic bayside enclave of Sausalito on the half-day tour from San Francisco. We traveled across the Golden Gate Bridge to visit Muir Woods, home to some of the oldest and tallest trees on Earth. It was just breath taking standing next to these massive trees, yes trees, something most people don’t think of flying all this way to see but it was so worth it. We soaked up some stellar views of the San Francisco skyline and browsed art galleries along the Sausalito waterfront. It was one of my favorite spots to visit during the many times I have traveled to California.

<h4>Germany – Cologne (Koln)</h4>
<p>Cologne is my second home. This is one of the cities I spend every summer as a child. It is the largest city in the German Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia and the forth largest city in Germany. It is located within the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region, one of the major European metropolitan regions and the largest in Germany, with more than ten million inhabitants. One of my favorite places to go is the heart of the city. The Cologne Cathedral is the largest church in the city. With 509 steps exactly, you get an amazing view of the entire city and a great work out! You will want to hold you ears though because when those bells ring, they will vibrate your whole body. Besides the beautiful architecture. Germany is well known for there food. The amount of bakeries and shops full of goodies is a dream come true. I love going to the shops and grabbing the freshly baked pretzels. One of my favorite treats with Nutella on the side! It is a must have for anyone who has a sweet tooth.

<h4>Sunkhaze National Wildlife Refuge - Maine</h4>
<p>If you like long walks in nature, you will love the Sunkhaze National Wildlife Refuge. The Sunkhaze Meadows Unit protects the second-largest wetlands in Maine. Sunkhaze Stream bisects this unit and, with its six tributaries, creates a diversity of wetland communities. The bogs and stream wetlands, along with the adjacent upland, provide important habitat for many wildlife species. The Benton Unit is comprised of grassland, young mixed softwood-hardwood forest, and small wetland habitats. If you are quite enough, you will see a variety of land bird species. For example you may see the American woodcock, and bobolink. This place is perfect for families, friends or a peaceful walk for one.

<h4>Twisted Falls - North Carolina</h4>
<p> After a long drive and steep hike, we finally made it to Twisting Falls. This breath-taking waterfall is found in the Elk Mills area of Carter County near the border with North Carolina. This particular waterfall is a popular place to be in the summer. It's listed as 30 feet high, but that seems to be a low estimate. Of course it made me nervous watching the people climb the rope which was attached to the rocks and then either slide down or jump off the falls. These people included my own brother and sister who insist I take a slow Mo video of them while sliding down... Above the main falls, they were also jumping into another large pool from a high perch above. I decided to just climb back down instead of slidding down the waterfall although now I wish I did because it did look like a lot of fun!

<h4>Edinburgh - Scotland</h4>
<p>After a long nap due to a long trip from MA to the United Kingdom, we were ready to explore the city and see what Edinburgh had to offer. Every morning we would hear the local bagpipes filling the air of Edinburgh. You will see people dancing along to the beat and spread the joy. One of my favorite things about this city is the Edinburgh Castle. The Edinburgh Castle is a historic fortress which dominates the skyline of Edinburgh, Scotland, from its position on the Castle Rock. Just about everywhere we walked, we could see it. It was the first thing I saw when arriving at the train station and the last thing I saw before leaving to go back home.

<h4>The Great Smokey Mountains - Tennessee</h4>
<p>The Great Smokey Mountains is a great place for a family trip! There are several short nature trails and family friendly trails in the park that are perfect for exploring with children or for those who need an easy hike. Although I hike a lot, I was extremely tired after hiking the smokes. The cool thing about these trails is that the park will award you with the mileage you did that day. You can stickers or pins showing how much you accomplished and more. The only challenge is to keep track and record the mileage from each trail excursion. Regardless, these trails are a great way to connect with nature and the views are more than rewarding!

<h4>The Mall - Washington DC</h4>
<p>On our road trip home from Tennessee/North Carolina we stopped in Washington DC for a few hours. This was my first time visiting The National Mall. I am so lucky to be able to see what Washington DC had to offer because it has symbolized our nation which had inspired the world. I truly recommend visiting Washington, but do pack appropriate because the summers are very hot and humid. Although we were not there for long, we enjoyed playing Frisbee on the grass and grabbing a bite to eat before packing up and continue driving home.

<h4>Utah – Bryce Canyon National Park</h4>
<p>After leaving Zion in the afternoon we drove a few hours to Bryce Canyon. Arriving late at night, we pitched a tent to sleep in 30 degrees. We decided we wanted to catch the sunrise at Bryce, so we got up at 5am this morning and set out to inspiration point. We caught the sunrise and munched on some delicious camp-cooked bacon and eggs with yucca and avocado. After breakfast we were going to continue on to Antelope canyon, but due to reservations being fully booked, and having to wait until the next morning for a tour, we decided to hike at Bryce. There was snow in the forecast but we still decided to hike the peek-a boo- loop trail. Luckily, no snow came our way but the weather constantly changed from warm to cold with partially cloudy skies. We found a nice tree to hang out on (literally hang out on) while we brewed some coffee with a mid-day snack. That's when I burned my finger through the flesh to the point that the burn didn't even hurt. We took the upper rim trail from Bryce point, an 8,300-foot elevation to return to our original start point of the peek-a-boo trail at sunset point. In the end we hiked about 7 miles through Bryce Canyon.

<h4>Zion NP Utah – The Subway</h4>
<p>After a morning sunrise and breakfast at the Zion Canyon Overlook, we checked in at the Visitor Center just to find out the Narrows was closed due to high water levels.  Although we were bummed, I was happy to get to hike The Subway instead, a 9-mile round trip strenuous hike requiring route finding (follow the hippie stones), stream crossing, and scrambling over boulders. They weren't lying. It was all of those, including hiking up and around some waterfalls! As soon as we hiked down into the valley, we realized we forgot sunscreen, on one of the few hot and sunny days ... Oops! With water levels being higher than usual, we had a little more fun crossing the stream as well. But it was all worth it to get to the Subway at the end! Especially hiking up all the waterfalls. After our hike we saw an amazing sunset on our way to our campground, and then set up camp close to a stream with a campfire, chili, and s'mores!
