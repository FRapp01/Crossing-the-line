<h1>Utah – Bryce Canyon National Park</h1>
<p>After leaving Zion in the afternoon we drove a few hours to Bryce Canyon. Arriving late at night, we pitched a tent to sleep in 30 degrees. We decided we wanted to catch the sunrise at Bryce, so we got up at 5am this morning and set out to inspiration point. We caught the sunrise and munched on some delicious camp-cooked bacon and eggs with yucca and avocado. After breakfast we were going to continue on to Antelope canyon, but due to reservations being fully booked, and having to wait until the next morning for a tour, we decided to hike at Bryce. There was snow in the forecast but we still decided to hike the peek-a boo- loop trail. Luckily, no snow came our way but the weather constantly changed from warm to cold with partially cloudy skies. We found a nice tree to hang out on (literally hang out on) while we brewed some coffee with a mid-day snack. That's when I burned my finger through the flesh to the point that the burn didn't even hurt. We took the upper rim trail from Bryce point, an 8,300-foot elevation to return to our original start point of the peek-a-boo trail at sunset point. In the end we hiked about 7 miles through Bryce Canyon.
