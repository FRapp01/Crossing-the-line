<h2>Trip Planning</h2>

<h3>What to do when traveling with pets.</h3>
<p> 1. Pack some of your pets favorite toys to give them the comforts of home. Pets can get a little freaked out by the sudden change in their surroundings, but you can help minimize the disruption by maintaining some level of familiarity. This can will include their toys, food, bedding, and even things like there beds, so they have at least a few familiar items.
<br><br>
2. Use a carrier. The Humane Society recommends keeping both dogs and cats in carriers while in moving vehicles. Cats in particular don't enjoy car travel, but carriers help to minimize stress and keep them stable. Don't forget to restrain the carrier by securing a seatbelt around the front, so it doesn't slide all over the place.
<br><br>
3. Make sure to read up on policies. For example, if you’re traveling by plane, review the airline's pet policy in advance. The Humane Society strongly discourages putting pets in the cargo hold, for safety and stress reasons. Make sure you research thoroughly ahead of time to avoid any issues at the airport.
<br><br>
4. Make frequent stops. You may be able to tolerate six hours of driving without stopping, but it's unlikely your pet can. If you're driving with your dog, make regular stops for bathroom breaks, stretching, and fresh air/snack breaks. Cats don’t need quite as many stops, but plan a few short breaks so they can get out of their carriers to move about the car and use the litter box.</p>

<h3>Fight sea sickness with these tips</h3>
<p>1. Get a prescription. The last time you were on a boat, you may have noticed some people with little white circles behind their ears. It wasn’t a fashion statement. Scopolamine patches are used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by motion sickness. When applied at least four hours before you board, each patch is good for three days—enough time to allow you to enjoy some excursions and catch some sun. Going on a weeklong cruise? Throw a patch a compact bag, such as the Pack-It Specter Wristlet Set, and you’ll have it with you when it’s time to reapply. Make an appointment with your general practitioner to discuss whether this type of a prescription is a good idea for you.
<br><br>
2. Eat for the sea. While it might be hard to skip out on the all-you-can-eat buffet, passing on the greasy, spicy, and acidic foods could be just what you need to settle your stomach. Instead of piling your plate high, reach for a Granny Smith. It turns out, an apple a day doesn’t just keep the doctor away; it can keep seasickness at bay, too. The pectin in green apples helps neutralize acid in the stomach, while the natural sugar helps settle the stomach. Ginger tea, powdered capsules, or ginger candies can also help treat nausea. Sipping on water as opposed to downing alcohol (a diuretic that speeds up dehydration) can also make you less susceptible to motion sickness. </p>

<h3>It's time to replace your travel bag.</h3>
<p>1. Today’s travel bags are large enough to hold all of your essential items inside but also small enough to fit inside a plane's overhead compartment. If you embrace minimalist travel, you will not only be a trendy traveler, but you will also save money and spare your body from lugging around a big, heavy suitcase. 
<br><br>
2. It’s falling apart. It might be time to retire it. While you can pay to have many types of luggage damage repaired, it’s not always cost-effective or possible. The last thing you want is your bag completely falling apart on you while you're on the road! If you have any doubts about whether your bag is still in travel-ready condition, take it for a spin on a bumpy sidewalk.
<br><br>
3. It’s ugly, or you don’t like it anymore. This is, of course, the most shallow reason to replace your luggage—but that doesn’t make it invalid. There are such things as great-looking bags that still do an excellent job carrying your stuff. If you have had the same, battered suitcase for years and are starting to feel self-conscious about bringing it on the road with you, it might be worth it to upgrade. </p>
